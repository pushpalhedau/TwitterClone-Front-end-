# TwitterClone-Front-end-
I am Glad to share that my First VIEH Internship Porject on my Github account.
Durning the internship I created a Twitter Official website Clone!
This project helped me in unskill my frontend development knowledge.
The main reason I chose this project is to try to copy exact twitter official website created by the professionals.
I used basic front languages like HTML, CSS and Javascript along with Xampp Server as a localhost and VS-code as IDE.
NOTE- COPY AND PASTE THE WHOLE FOLDER IN "C" DRIVE >>XAMPP >>HTDOCS BEFORE RUNNING IT ON BROWSER.
